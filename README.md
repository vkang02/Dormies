# Our Motive
Inspired by the housing crisis at UC Santa Cruz, our goal is to create an application where students are able to solve their 
housing situation as quickly and safely as possible. Scams and untrustworthy housemates have become more common as the ratio
of students to available housing are becoming more unbalanced through the years. Dormies aims to provide speed and efficiency
and allow them to focus on what is most important, their studies. 

# Description: 
The idea is to allow users to create a profile that includes their living styles, the characteristics they look for in a 
housemate, ratings and reviews of current/past housemates/landlords, etc. Users are able to post pictures of houses they are 
currently living at, descriptions of houses they are living at or types of houses they desire. A chat box will also allow 
them to chat with each other in real time. A timeline of recent postings will allow them to scroll through wherever they find
convenient through their phone. Notifications will tell them when they have received a message or if a match has been found
for them (they will be able to turn this off when they are not looking for housing).
